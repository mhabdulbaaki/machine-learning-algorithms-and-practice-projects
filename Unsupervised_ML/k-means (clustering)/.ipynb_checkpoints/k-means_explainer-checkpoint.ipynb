    "## 1 - Implementing K-means\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar\n",
    "data points together. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Concretely, you are given a training set $\\{x^{(1)}, ..., x^{(m)}\\}$, and you want\n",
    "to group the data into a few cohesive “clusters”. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* K-means is an iterative procedure that\n",
    "     * Starts by guessing the initial centroids, and then \n",
    "     * Refines this guess by \n",
    "         * Repeatedly assigning examples to their closest centroids, and then \n",
    "         * Recomputing the centroids based on the assignments.\n",
    "         \n",
    "\n",
    "* In pseudocode, the K-means algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    # Initialize centroids\n",
    "    # K is the number of clusters\n",
    "    centroids = kMeans_init_centroids(X, K)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for iter in range(iterations):\n",
    "        # Cluster assignment step: \n",
    "        # Assign each data point to the closest centroid. \n",
    "        # idx[i] corresponds to the index of the centroid \n",
    "        # assigned to example i\n",
    "        idx = find_closest_centroids(X, centroids)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Move centroid step: \n",
    "        # Compute means based on centroid assignments\n",
    "        centroids = compute_means(X, idx, K)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The inner-loop of the algorithm repeatedly carries out two steps: \n",
    "    * (i) Assigning each training example $x^{(i)}$ to its closest centroid, and\n",
    "    * (ii) Recomputing the mean of each centroid using the points assigned to it. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* The $K$-means algorithm will always converge to some final set of means for the centroids. \n",
    "\n",
    "* However, that the converged solution may not always be ideal and depends on the initial setting of the centroids.\n",
    "    * Therefore, in practice the K-means algorithm is usually run a few times with different random initializations. \n",
    "    * One way to choose between these different solutions from different random initializations is to choose the one with the lowest cost function value (distortion).\n",
